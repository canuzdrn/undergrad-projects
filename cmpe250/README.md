# CmpE-250
CmpE 250 - Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

### Discrete Event Simulator
A discrete event simulation that models the operations of a tennis foundation as a discrete sequence of events in time

### Dormitory Simulator
A program for simulating the distribution of student houses

### Help the Santa Claus
A project that finds the maximum number of gifts that can be delivered from different type of bags to different type of vehicles
- Dinic's Algorithm is used

### Love Story
There is a map represented as a graph which has an articulation point that divides the graph into two parts while one of the parts designed to be directed and the other part is designed to be undirected
- Project's aim is finding the shortest path between two nodes in the directed part of the graph and finding the minimum spanning tree on the undirected part of the graph
- Dijkstra's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm are used
